  <!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
  <main class="container">
    <section>
      <p>
        I am a husband of nineteen years and a committed father of three. Family is my anchor and my compass.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Northern Ontario, Canada, where my earliest education came from the woods and the lakes — hunting, fishing,
        and exploring the land. Those roots have never left me. They shaped my love of nature, my sense of reciprocity, and my
        understanding that life is strongest when lived in relationship with others and the land itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I served as a soldier in the Canadian Army with the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry, including a tour in Bosnia.
        The discipline, hardship, and presence I learned there would later be tempered by very different experiences — as a semi-professional
        road and track cyclist, a top-level Canadian biathlete, and a yachtsman who skippered his own boat through the Irish Sea to Scotland
        and the Hebrides. Each path has taught me endurance, clarity, and how to steady myself in the face of storms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Horses have been another constant thread. I spent years riding, training, and working within the Western pleasure and polo world,
        and later on horse studs and cattle and sheep stations in New Zealand and Australia. I trained as a blacksmith and farrier, using
        the forge and the anvil to step away from military life and back into my roots — learning patience, skill, and respect for raw strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I worked as a doorman in rough places where communication wasn’t theory — it was survival. Speaking with authenticity and
        truth could mean saving face or saving life. Those lessons in respect, integrity, and presence have shaped how I show up in every part of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also walked closely with hardship and suffering — in my hometown, abroad, and through my work with Indigenous communities in Canada,
        Australia, and New Zealand. They have taught me the deep lesson of reciprocity: if someone cannot speak my language, it is my work to learn theirs,
        or to find the common ground where we can meet without conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, life carried me from Canada to Ireland. To live among new peoples and customs was to begin again — learning another culture, listening
        more than speaking, and finding my place within it. What I discovered is that, no matter where you go, the <em>law of human-heartedness</em> prevails.
        To follow that thread is to live a life of virtue and presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentoring has grown naturally from this life. I have been shaped by mentors who gave me their time, skills, and care. Without them, I would be in a very
        different place. The mentor–mentee relationship is sacred. It tempers and hones, holds back and spurs on, lessens troughs and lengthens peaks. Some find it
        by luck. Others must seek it out.
      </p>

    <!-- THE NOBLE MASCULINE (pull-quote) -->
    <section aria-labelledby="noble-masculine" style="margin-top:2rem;">
      <h2 id="noble-masculine">The Noble Masculine</h2>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p><strong>“To live the Noble Masculine is to always build a bridge for others — to find rapport and common ground with everyone you meet.
        It is the ability to extend your sense of self to encompass others, and to hold that space until they are ready to build their own.
        True strength lies in our connections; presence can exist without posturing; and resilience is the balance understanding our strenth and our connections.
        It is possible to sit quietly, and still hold the respect of others.”</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <!-- CLOSE -->
    <section style="margin-top:1rem;">
      <p>
        My work now is to offer that presence — to bring balance, clarity, and steadiness so that others can find their way forward,
        not into someone else’s pattern, but into their own strength and truth.
      </p>
